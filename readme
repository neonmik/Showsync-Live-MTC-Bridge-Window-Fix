A short AppleScript to fix unexpected behavior of Showsync's Live MTC Bridge app in Big Sur (and possibly other OS's). 

This app would appear with the title bar off screen, but the window wasn't resizable, making it impossible to move/use properly. 

This just moves the window to the centre of the main screen so that it can be used as normal.
